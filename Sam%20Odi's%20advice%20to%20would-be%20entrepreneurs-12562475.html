<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">just do it. The only way to become an entrepreneur is by being an entrepreneur. It&rsquo;s hard work, but a man who loves his work doesn&rsquo;t have to work a single day of his life. Just do it. Just do it now and figure out the details later. People hold themselves back. They worry too much and they hold themselves back &ndash; we&rsquo;re trained to find reasons why things won&rsquo;t work. You can always find a reason why it won&rsquo;t work. <em>People who are successful are ones who find reasons why it will work.</em><br /></blockquote>
