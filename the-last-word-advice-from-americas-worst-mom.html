<div class='post_body'><blockquote>I really think I&rsquo;m a parent who is afraid of some things (bears, cars) and less afraid of others (subways, strangers). But mostly I&rsquo;m afraid that I, too, have been swept up in the impossible obsession of our era: total safety for our children every second of every day. The idea that we should provide it and actually could provide it. It&rsquo;s as if we don&rsquo;t believe in fate anymore, or good luck or bad luck. No, it&rsquo;s all up to us. Childhood really has changed since today&rsquo;s parents were kids, and not just in the United States. Australian children get stared at when they ride the bus alone. Canadian kids stay inside playing video games. After I started a blog called Free Range Kids, I heard from a dad in Ireland who lets his 11-year-old play in the local park, unsupervised, and now a mom down the street won&rsquo;t let her son go to their house. She thinks the dad is reckless. What has changed in the English-speaking world that has made childhood independence taboo? The ground has not gradually gotten harder under the jungle gym. The bus stops have not crept farther from home. Crime is actually lower than it was when most of us were growing up. So there is no reality-based reason that children today should be treated as more helpless and vulnerable than we were when we were young. If parents all around us are clutching their children close, it&rsquo;s easy to understand why: It&rsquo;s what pop culture is telling us to do. Stories of kidnappings swamp the news. Go online, and you can find a map of local sex offenders as easily as the local Victoria&rsquo;s Secret (possibly in the same place). Meantime, if you do summon the courage to put your kids on a bus or a bench or a bike, other parents keep butting in: An unwatched child is a tragedy waiting to happen.</blockquote>
