      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>This is my experience with hg-git.  Mercurial tags can be moved, Git tags can't be, so I need to keep that in mind.  Mercurial signatures don't map to Git ones for obvious reasons or vice-versa, so I can't actually figure out whether a given release was signed by the project author.  Mercurial branches lack Git analogs, so I have to remember not to use them.  Mercurial bookmarks map to Git branches, so I have to be ready for bookmarks to move in odd ways as Git users work with my hg-git repository.  Mercurial's multiple heads per branch have no real analog in Git (they'd be up for garbage collection).  This list goes on.</p><p>When I use hg-git, I have to always keep the Git model in my head, AND keep the Mercurial model in my head, AND keep in mind how those two models interact.  This isn't fun, and it's not anything remotely close to transparent.  It's amazingly impressive how well hg-git works, but claiming that GitHub supports Mercurial due to hg-git is horribly misleading.</p></blockquote>
