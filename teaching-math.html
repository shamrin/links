<p>Found a link to an interesting&nbsp;<a href="http://jumpmath.org/">Jump Math</a> program (via <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/a-better-way-to-teach-math/">New York Times blog post</a> and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2462224">HN</a>). Some materials can be downloaded. <a href="http://jumpmath.org/TM%2520for%2520Introductory%2520Unit%2520Using%2520Fractions.pdf">Extract</a>&nbsp;(pdf):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Emphasize the positive.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If a child gets three out of four questions wrong, I will mark the question that is correct first and praise&nbsp;them for getting the correct answer. Then I will say, &ldquo;I think you didn&rsquo;t understand something with&nbsp;these other questions&rdquo; or &ldquo;You may have been going too fast,&rdquo; and then I will point out their mistake&nbsp;&ndash; or ask them to find it themselves! I&rsquo;ve found that if I start by mentioning the mistakes, a weaker&nbsp;student will sometimes simply give up or stop listening. If a student is upset by their mistakes, I will&nbsp;sometimes make up a bonus question (that I know they can do) to show them they are capable of&nbsp;doing harder work. (I also tell students that even though I am a mathematician I often make mistakes.&nbsp;And I often start a lesson by telling students that if they don&rsquo;t understand something it is my fault for&nbsp;not explaining it well enough, so they shouldn&rsquo;t feel embarrassed at asking me to explain something&nbsp;again.)</p>
